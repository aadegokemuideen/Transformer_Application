# Transformer Application for Text Translation

Welcome to the Transformer Application repository! This project explores the application of Transformer architecture/model for natural language processing tasks, particularly focusing on text translation between different languages. The goal is to develop a deep understanding of the Transformer architecture by building it from scratch.

**Note: This project is currently in progress, and the README file will be updated further once the project is completed.**
